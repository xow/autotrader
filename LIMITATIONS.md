# AutoTrader Bot - Current Limitations

This document outlines the known limitations and areas for improvement in the current implementation of the AutoTrader bot. These limitations should be carefully considered before using the bot with real funds.

## Simulation vs. Reality

### Order Execution
- **Slippage**: The simulation assumes instant execution at the exact price, which may not reflect real market conditions
- **Order Book Depth**: Does not account for order book depth when executing trades
- **Market Impact**: Does not consider how the bot's own trades might affect the market
- **Partial Fills**: Currently assumes all orders are completely filled

### Market Data
- **Historical Data**: Relies on historical data that may not predict future market behavior
- **Market Regimes**: May not perform well during different market conditions (e.g., high volatility, flash crashes)
- **News & Events**: Does not account for major news events or economic announcements
- **Market Hours**: Does not consider exchange-specific trading hours or maintenance periods

## Technical Implementation

### Model Limitations
- **Overfitting**: The LSTM model may be overfitting to historical data
- **Feature Engineering**: Current feature set may not capture all relevant market dynamics
- **Lookahead Bias**: Need to ensure no future data leaks into training
- **Model Drift**: No automatic mechanism to detect when the model needs retraining

### Performance
- **Latency**: Does not account for network latency in real trading
- **Error Handling**: Limited handling of API failures or network issues
- **Resource Usage**: May require optimization for long-running operation
- **Backtesting**: Limited backtesting framework for strategy validation

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Risk Per Trade**: Fixed percentage risk may not be optimal for all market conditions
- **Portfolio Diversity**: Only trades a single pair (BTC-AUD)
- **Leverage**: Does not support leveraged trading
- **Correlation**: Does not account for correlation with other assets

### Drawdown Control
- **Stop-Loss**: Basic stop-loss implementation
- **Maximum Drawdown**: No hard limit on maximum drawdown
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Does not adjust position size based on market volatility
- **Black Swan Events**: No specific handling for extreme market conditions

## Operational Considerations

### Exchange Integration
- **Single Exchange**: Only supports BTCMarkets exchange
- **API Rate Limits**: Basic rate limiting but may need adjustment
- **Withdrawal Limits**: Does not account for exchange withdrawal limits
- **Security**: API key security is the responsibility of the user

### Monitoring & Reporting
- **Basic Logging**: Limited operational metrics
- **Alerting**: No built-in alerting system
- **Performance Metrics**: Limited trading performance analytics
- **Tax Reporting**: No tax reporting functionality

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Simulation**
   - Add realistic order book simulation
   - Implement slippage models
   - Simulate market impact of trades

2. **Advanced Risk Management**
   - Dynamic position sizing
   - Volatility-based adjustments
   - Multi-asset correlation

3. **Improved Model**
   - Regular retraining schedule
   - Model performance monitoring
   - Ensemble approaches

4. **Operational Robustness**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Automated recovery procedures
   - Detailed performance reporting
