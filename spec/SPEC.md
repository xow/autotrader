# Autotrader Bot Specification

## Introduction
The autotrader bot is an artificial intelligence system designed to learn optimal trades using machine learning algorithms and real-time data from BTCMarkets. The primary objective of this project is to develop a trading strategy that maximizes profits while minimizing risks.

## Objectives
1. Use machine learning to analyze market trends and patterns in order to predict profitable trades.
2. Integrate with the BTCMarkets API to retrieve live market data.
3. Simulate trades using historical data to test and refine our trading strategies without risking actual capital.

## Technical Requirements
- Programming languages: Python 3.x
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras for machine learning; Requests or similar library for interacting with the BTCMarkets API.
- Libraries/tools:
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - Matplotlib and/or Seaborn for data visualization

## System Design
The system will consist of the following key components:

- Data Ingestion Module: Responsible for retrieving live market data from BTCMarkets using their API.
- Machine Learning Model: Trained on historical data to predict profitable trades.
- Simulation Engine: Simulates trades based on the predictions made by the machine learning model.

Please note that this is a basic outline and will require further expansion and refinement as we progress with the project.
