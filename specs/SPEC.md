# SPEC: Continuous Learning Autotrader Bot for Optimal Cryptocurrency Trading

## Introduction

The autotrader bot is designed as a continuously learning trading system that utilizes machine learning to optimize cryptocurrency trading decisions using live data from BTCMarkets. The system is specifically architected for long-term autonomous operation, capable of running unattended for extended periods (hours, days, or overnight) while continuously improving its predictive capabilities through real-time learning.

## Core Requirements
