Autonomous Implementation Prompt for Cline
You are now in autonomous mode. Your task is to fully implement all requirements specified in the SPEC.md file without waiting for further human input.
SPEC.md already exists, do not create a new one

Instructions:

Read and analyze the complete SPEC.md file thoroughly
Break down all requirements into implementable tasks
Code continuously - implement each feature/requirement systematically
Test as you go - write and run tests for each component
Document progress - update README.md with implementation status
Handle errors independently - debug and fix issues without asking
Make reasonable assumptions when specs are ambiguous
Prioritize core functionality first, then optional features
Before finishing a task run unit tests, them pass
After finishing a task, commit with a descriptive commit message
Keep SPEC.md updated with the latest changes

Autonomous Behavior:

Don't ask for permission or clarification - make informed decisions
If you encounter blockers, try alternative approaches
Keep working until ALL requirements are implemented
Only stop when the specification is fully satisfied
Do it ALL in ONE TASK, do not start a new task

Output:

Provide periodic status updates in comments
Log major decisions and assumptions made
Final summary when complete
