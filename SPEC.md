# SPEC: Autotrader Bot for Optimal Trades Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The autotrader bot is designed to learn optimal trades using machine learning and get live data from BTCMarkets. The primary goal of this project is to create a sophisticated trading system that can simulate trades based on real-time market data.

## Requirements

- The bot should be able to retrieve live market data from BTCMarkets.
- The bot should utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict optimal trades.
- The bot should only make simulated trades, without executing actual trades.
- The bot should support long-term autonomous training sessions that can run unattended for extended periods (e.g., overnight).
- The bot should save training data and model state to persistent storage for resuming training sessions.
- The bot should be able to load previously saved training data and continue training from where it left off.

## Design Overview

The autotrader bot will consist of the following components:

* A data ingestion module that retrieves live market data from BTCMarkets.
* A machine learning module that analyzes the market data and predicts optimal trades.
* A simulation module that simulates trades based on the predicted outcomes.
* A persistence module that handles saving and loading of training data and model states.
* A training orchestrator that manages long-term training sessions with checkpointing.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

The machine learning algorithm will use TensorFlow to implement a neural network capable of handling real-time market data and predicting optimal trades with high accuracy. The algorithm will be trained using historical market data from BTCMarkets and will support:

* Continuous learning from live market data streams
* Model checkpointing at regular intervals to prevent data loss
* Incremental training that can resume from saved model states
* Long-term autonomous training sessions that can run unattended for hours or days

## Data Sources (BTCMarkets)

The bot will retrieve live market data from BTCMarkets, which provides accurate and up-to-date information on cryptocurrency markets.

## Data Persistence and Training Continuity

The bot will implement a robust data persistence system that includes:

* **Training Data Storage**: All market data used for training will be saved to timestamped files, allowing for data replay and analysis.
* **Model Checkpointing**: TensorFlow model weights and optimizer states will be saved at configurable intervals (e.g., every hour or after processing a certain number of data points).
* **Training Session Logs**: Comprehensive logging of training progress, including loss metrics, accuracy scores, and system performance data.
* **Resume Capability**: The ability to detect and load the most recent checkpoint when restarting the bot, continuing training seamlessly from the last saved state.
* **Data Validation**: Integrity checks to ensure saved data and models are not corrupted before resuming training.

## Simulated Trades

The bot will simulate trades based on the predicted outcomes of the machine learning algorithm. This will allow users to test and evaluate the performance of the bot without executing actual trades.

### Trade Execution Logging

The simulation module will provide real-time feedback on trading decisions by:

* **Buy Order Notifications**: When the ML model predicts a favorable buy opportunity, the bot will print detailed information including:
  - Timestamp of the decision
  - Cryptocurrency pair (e.g., BTC/AUD)
  - Predicted buy price
  - Simulated order quantity
  - Total simulated investment value
  - Confidence score of the ML prediction

* **Sell Order Notifications**: When the ML model predicts an optimal sell point, the bot will print:
  - Timestamp of the decision
  - Cryptocurrency pair
  - Predicted sell price
  - Simulated order quantity
  - Total simulated sale value
  - Profit/loss calculation from the corresponding buy order
  - Confidence score of the ML prediction

* **Portfolio Updates**: After each simulated trade, the bot will display:
  - Current simulated portfolio balance
  - Total profit/loss since training began
  - Number of successful vs unsuccessful trades
  - Current holdings breakdown

## Implementation Details

- The bot will be built using Python with TensorFlow for the neural network implementation.
- The machine learning model will support checkpointing and model saving/loading capabilities.
- Training data will be continuously saved to files (CSV/JSON format) with timestamps for data integrity.
- Model weights and training state will be saved at regular intervals using TensorFlow's checkpoint system.
- The system will include a resume functionality that can load previous training data and model states.
- The data ingestion module will utilize APIs provided by BTCMarkets to retrieve live market data.
- Error handling and logging will be implemented to ensure robust long-term operation.
- The bot will include configurable training parameters (learning rate, batch size, save intervals, etc.).
