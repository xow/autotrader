# SPEC: Autotrader Bot for Optimal Trades Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The autotrader bot is designed to learn optimal trades using machine learning and get live data from BTCMarkets. The primary goal of this project is to create a sophisticated trading system that can simulate trades based on real-time market data.

## Requirements

- The bot should be able to retrieve live market data from BTCMarkets.
- The bot should utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict optimal trades.
- The bot should only make simulated trades, without executing actual trades.

## Design Overview

The autotrader bot will consist of the following components:

* A data ingestion module that retrieves live market data from BTCMarkets.
* A machine learning module that analyzes the market data and predicts optimal trades.
* A simulation module that simulates trades based on the predicted outcomes.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

The machine learning algorithm used in this project should be able to handle real-time market data and predict optimal trades with high accuracy. The algorithm can be trained using historical market data from BTCMarkets.

## Data Sources (BTCMarkets)

The bot will retrieve live market data from BTCMarkets, which provides accurate and up-to-date information on cryptocurrency markets.

## Simulated Trades

The bot will simulate trades based on the predicted outcomes of the machine learning algorithm. This will allow users to test and evaluate the performance of the bot without executing actual trades.

## Implementation Details

- The bot will be built using a programming language such as Python or Node.js.
- The machine learning algorithm will be implemented using a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- The data ingestion module will utilize APIs provided by BTCMarkets to retrieve live market data.
